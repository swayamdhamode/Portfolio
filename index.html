											<h3><a href="#">About Me</a></h3>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="./images/pp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Hello! I am Swayam Jitendra Dhamode, a first-year mechanical engineering
											student at Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering with a passion
											for innovation and problem-solving. From a young age, I've been captivated
											by how things work, and my journey into mechanical engineering has been a
											natural progression of that curiosity.

											My fascination with fabrication laboratories (fab labs) stems from their
											ability to bridge theoretical knowledge with hands-on application. In my
											first year, I've eagerly immersed myself in exploring the myriad
											possibilities offered by fab lab technologies.

											Driven by a desire to contribute meaningfully to society, I see mechanical
											engineering as a pathway to designing solutions that address real-world
											challenges. Whether it's designing more efficient machinery, creating
											sustainable energy solutions, or improving everyday products, I am excited
											by the prospect of making a tangible impact through my work.

											Outside of academics, I enjoy engaging in extracurricular activities that
											complement my studies. From participating in engineering competitions to
											collaborating on group projects, I thrive in environments that foster
											collaboration, creativity, and innovation.

											Looking ahead, I am committed to continually expanding my knowledge and
											skills in mechanical engineering, particularly in the realm of fab labs. I
											am eager to embrace new challenges, learn from experiences, and contribute
											to the ever-evolving field of engineering.

											Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to
											sharing more about my academic and professional journey with you.
